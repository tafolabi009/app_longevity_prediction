# App Longevity Prediction

This project collects and analyzes app data from various sources to predict app longevity and success metrics.

## Enhanced Data Collection

The data collection script (`scripts/data_collection.py`) gathers app data from multiple sources:

1. **Official App Stores**:
   - Google Play Store (via google-play-scraper)
   - Apple App Store (via app-store-scraper)

2. **Third-Party Analytics Platforms** (via web scraping):
   - Sensor Tower
   - App Annie (data.ai)
   - AppBrain (for Android apps)

## Requirements

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To collect app data:

```bash
python scripts/data_collection.py
```

The script will:
- Fetch data from multiple sources for popular apps
- Perform sentiment analysis on app reviews using TextBlob
- Apply feature engineering to generate additional metrics
- Save the processed data to `data/raw/app_data_final.csv`

## Data Processing

The collected data goes through several processing steps:
1. Basic collection from primary sources
2. Augmentation with data from additional sources  
3. Feature engineering (sentiment analysis, time-based metrics, etc.)
4. Data validation and cleaning
